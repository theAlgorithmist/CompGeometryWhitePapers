# White Papers on Computational Geometry

This repository contains the original PDF's for the Computational Geometry TechNote series I wrote back in the 2000's while working predominantly as a Flash/Flex developer.  The supporting ActionScript code no longer exists, however, some of the work has been re-created in Angular/Typescript and is available elsewhere in my GitHub.
